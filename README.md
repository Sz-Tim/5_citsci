# Opération Fourmis Repo 5
## Citizen Science

This repository focuses on Opération Fourmis from the perspective of the citizen science data. That will include some description of the data, sampling biases, etc, and also maybe some investigation into differences between habitat types or effects of city vs. non-city species or something like that.
